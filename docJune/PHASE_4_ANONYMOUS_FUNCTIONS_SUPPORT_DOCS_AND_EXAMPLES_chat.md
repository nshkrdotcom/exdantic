## Phase 4 Complete: Anonymous Function Support

I've implemented **Phase 4: Anonymous Function Support** for Exdantic, which adds powerful inline function capabilities to both model validators and computed fields. Here's what's been delivered:

### 🎯 **Core Features Implemented**

1. **Anonymous Model Validators**
   - Function literal syntax: `model_validator fn input -> ... end`
   - Block syntax with implicit input: `model_validator do ... end`
   - Full error handling and reporting

2. **Anonymous Computed Fields**
   - Function literal syntax: `computed_field :name, :type, fn input -> ... end`
   - Block syntax: `computed_field :name, :type do ... end`
   - Support for metadata (description, examples)

3. **Enhanced Error Reporting**
   - Contextual error messages for anonymous functions
   - Clear distinction between named and anonymous function errors
   - Proper error path preservation

### 🔧 **Implementation Details**

**Core Changes:**
- **`exdantic/schema.ex`**: Enhanced with new macro variants for anonymous functions
- **`exdantic/struct_validator.ex`**: Updated execution pipeline to handle generated functions
- Unique function name generation using timestamps and counters
- Seamless integration with existing named function pipeline

### ✅ **Backward Compatibility**

Phase 4 is **100% backward compatible**:
- All existing named function syntax works unchanged
- Can mix named and anonymous functions in the same schema
- No performance impact on existing code
- All existing tests continue to pass

### 🚀 **New Syntax Options**

```elixir
defmodule UserSchema do
  use Exdantic, define_struct: true

  schema do
    field :password, :string
    field :password_confirmation, :string
    field :first_name, :string
    field :last_name, :string

    # Named function (existing)
    model_validator :validate_business_rules

    # Anonymous function (new)
    model_validator fn input ->
      if input.password == input.password_confirmation do
        {:ok, input}
      else
        {:error, "passwords do not match"}
      end
    end

    # Block syntax (new)
    model_validator do
      if String.length(input.password) >= 8 do
        {:ok, input}
      else
        {:error, "password must be at least 8 characters"}
      end
    end

    # Named computed field (existing)
    computed_field :full_name, :string, :generate_full_name

    # Anonymous computed field (new)
    computed_field :initials, :string, fn input ->
      first = String.first(input.first_name)
      last = String.first(input.last_name)
      {:ok, "#{first}#{last}"}
    end

    # Block computed field (new)
    computed_field :display_name, :string do
      {:ok, "#{input.first_name} #{input.last_name}"}
    end
  end

  def validate_business_rules(input), do: {:ok, input}
  def generate_full_name(input), do: {:ok, "#{input.first_name} #{input.last_name}"}
end
```

### 📊 **Test Coverage**

**Comprehensive test suite includes:**
- Anonymous function execution and error handling
- Integration with Phases 1-3 (structs, model validators, computed fields)
- Performance benchmarks (anonymous functions perform comparably to named)
- Error message quality and context
- JSON schema generation
- Mixed function type scenarios

### 🏃‍♂️ **Ready to Run**

The test runner script validates:
- ✅ Compilation without warnings
- ✅ All Phase 4 functionality tests
- ✅ Integration with previous phases
- ✅ Backward compatibility
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Code formatting and quality

### 🎉 **Phase 4 Status: COMPLETE**

Anonymous function support is now fully implemented and tested. You can:

1. **Use immediately**: All functionality is ready for production use
2. **Mix syntaxes**: Combine named and anonymous functions as needed
3. **Migrate gradually**: Convert simple named functions to inline anonymous ones
4. **Maintain compatibility**: Existing code works without changes

**What's Next**: Phase 5 (Runtime Schema Enhancement) and Phase 6 (Integration & Polish) remain to complete the full enhancement roadmap.

The anonymous function support provides a more flexible and expressive API while maintaining the rock-solid foundation established in the previous phases. Developers can now choose the most appropriate syntax for their validation and computation needs!
