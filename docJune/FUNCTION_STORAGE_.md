Looking at the function storage issue, there are several approaches to fully address this limitation. Let me analyze the options:The function storage issue has several viable solutions. Here's my analysis:

## **Recommended Solution: Hybrid Approach (Solution 3)**

This provides the best balance of flexibility, usability, and technical feasibility.

### **Why This Approach Wins:**

1. **🎯 Maximum Flexibility** - Users can choose the right syntax for their needs
2. **🔧 No Breaking Changes** - Fully backward compatible  
3. **⚡ Compile-time Safe** - All functions generated at compile time
4. **📝 Clean API** - Multiple syntax options for different complexity levels
5. **🚀 No External Dependencies** - Pure Elixir solution

### **Implementation Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Named Functions (Immediate)**
```elixir
schema do
  model_validator :validate_passwords  # Reference existing function
  computed_field :full_name, :string, :compute_full_name
end

def validate_passwords(data), do: # implementation
```

**Phase 2: Inline Block Functions**
```elixir
schema do
  model_validator do
    fn data ->
      if data.password == data.confirmation, do: {:ok, data}, else: {:error, "mismatch"}
    end
  end
end
```

**Phase 3: Direct Function Literals**
```elixir
schema do
  model_validator fn data -> 
    if data.age >= 18, do: {:ok, data}, else: {:error, "too young"}
  end
end
```

### **Technical Benefits:**

- ✅ **Solves Function Storage**: Generates named functions at compile time
- ✅ **Preserves Performance**: No runtime function resolution overhead  
- ✅ **Maintains Type Safety**: Dialyzer can analyze generated functions
- ✅ **Enables DSPy Patterns**: Full compatibility with Pydantic-style validation

### **Quick Implementation Estimate:**

- **Named Functions**: ~2 hours (modify existing macros)
- **Block Functions**: ~4 hours (AST handling + function generation)  
- **Function Literals**: ~2 hours (extend pattern matching)
- **Testing**: ~4 hours (comprehensive test coverage)
- **Total**: ~12 hours of focused development

This approach will give you **100% DSPy compatibility** with compile-time schemas while maintaining the elegant API that users expect. The hybrid syntax means users can start simple with named functions and graduate to more complex inline validation as needed.

Would you like me to implement the **Phase 1 (Named Functions)** solution first? It's the quickest path to full functionality and can be extended later with the other syntax options.
