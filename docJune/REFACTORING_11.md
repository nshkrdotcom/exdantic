Excellent question. Thinking in terms of leveraging "such gifts" is a smart way to accelerate development. Besides a core validator like `ExJsonSchema`, here are the other types of libraries you should search for that would fit perfectly into the `Alembic` vision, organized by the problem they solve.

---

### **1. For Data Coercion & Transformation**

This is the most significant "gift" you could find. Since we've decided to move complex transformations out of Alembic and into the client app (`ds_ex`), a powerful, dedicated transformation library would be a perfect companion.

*   **What to Search For:** Look for libraries that excel at transforming nested Elixir data structures (maps and lists) in a declarative or functional way.
*   **Ideal Keywords:** `elixir data mapping`, `elixir transformation`, `elixir struct coercion`, `elixir data shaping`.
*   **The "Gift" Would Look Like:** A library that lets you define transformation rules declaratively. For example:
    ```elixir
    # Hypothetical "Transmute" library
    Transmute.transform(data, %{
      full_name: from([:first_name, :last_name], &"#{&1} #{&2}"),
      email: from(:email, &String.downcase/1),
      age: from(:birth_date, &calculate_age/1)
    })
    ```
    **Why it fits:** This would live in your `ds_ex` application logic. It keeps the transformation explicit and separate from Alembic's validation, while still being declarative and clean. It's the perfect tool to use *after* `Alembic.Validator.validate/3` returns `{:ok, data}`.

### **2. For Error Handling and Reporting**

Alembic will produce structured error data. A library that helps format or handle these errors can be very useful.

*   **What to Search For:** Libraries that help manage and display `Ecto.Changeset`-style errors or general structured error data.
*   **Ideal Keywords:** `elixir error handling`, `elixir changeset errors`, `elixir error helpers`.
*   **The "Gift" Would Look Like:** A library that takes a list of `Alembic.Error` structs and easily formats them for Phoenix forms, JSON:API responses, or GraphQL errors.
    ```elixir
    # Hypothetical "Remedy" library
    case Alembic.Validator.validate(schema, data) do
      {:ok, _} -> ...
      {:error, errors} ->
        # Easily generate a map of user-friendly error messages
        json_errors = Remedy.to_json_api(errors)
        #=> %{"name" => ["is too short", "must contain letters"], "age" => ["must be over 18"]}
    end
    ```
    **Why it fits:** It keeps Alembic focused on *producing* structured errors, while the "gift" library focuses on *consuming and presenting* them.

### **3. For Performance-Critical Parsing (If Needed)**

If you find that `Jason` (or your chosen JSON decoder) becomes a bottleneck when validating massive volumes of data from an LLM, a more performant parser could be a gift.

*   **What to Search For:** Libraries that offer high-speed, low-level JSON parsing, often implemented as NIFs (Native Implemented Functions).
*   **Ideal Keywords:** `elixir fast json`, `elixir simd json`, `elixir rust nif json`.
*   **The "Gift" Would Look Like:** A library like `jiffy` (for Erlang) or a modern Rust-based equivalent like `rustler_json`.
    ```elixir
    # In your config/config.exs, you could make the decoder pluggable
    config :alembic, :json_decoder, {MyFastJson, :decode}
    ```
    **Why it fits:** It allows you to swap out a performance-critical component of the system without changing Alembic's core validation logic, treating the JSON parser as a pluggable dependency.
