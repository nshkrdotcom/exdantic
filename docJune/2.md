## Documentation Updates

### Update lib/exdantic/runtime.ex module docs
```elixir
@moduledoc """
Runtime schema generation and validation capabilities.

This module enables dynamic schema creation from field definitions at runtime,
supporting the DSPy pattern of `pydantic.create_model("DSPyProgramOutputs", **fields)`.

## Phase 5 Enhancement: Enhanced Runtime Schemas

Added support for enhanced runtime schemas with model validators and computed fields:

    # Create enhanced schema with full validation pipeline
    fields = [{:name, :string, [required: true]}, {:age, :integer, [optional: true]}]
    
    # Model validators for cross-field validation
    validators = [
      fn data -> {:ok, %{data | name: String.trim(data.name)}} end,
      {MyModule, :validate_age}
    ]
    
    # Computed fields for derived values
    computed_fields = [
      {:display_name, :string, fn data -> {:ok, String.upcase(data.name)} end},
      {:age_group, :string, {MyModule, :compute_age_group}}
    ]
    
    # Create enhanced schema
    schema = Runtime.create_enhanced_schema(fields,
      title: "User Schema",
      model_validators: validators,
      computed_fields: computed_fields
    )
    
    # Validate with full pipeline
    {:ok, result} = Runtime.validate_enhanced(%{name: "  john  ", age: 25}, schema)
    # Result: %{name: "john", age: 25, display_name: "JOHN", age_group: "adult"}

Enhanced schemas support:
- Model validators (both named functions and anonymous functions)
- Computed fields (both named functions and anonymous functions)  
- Full validation pipeline execution (field → model → computed)
- JSON Schema generation with enhanced metadata
- Integration with existing validation infrastructure

## Basic Runtime Schemas

For simple use cases without enhanced features:

    # Basic runtime schema
    fields = [{:name, :string, [required: true]}, {:age, :integer, [optional: true]}]
    schema = Runtime.create_schema(fields, title: "Basic User Schema")
    
    {:ok, validated} = Runtime.validate(%{name: "John", age: 30}, schema)
    # Result: %{name: "John", age: 30}

## Schema Types

- `DynamicSchema` - Basic runtime schema with field validation
- `EnhancedSchema` - Advanced runtime schema with model validators and computed fields

## Phase 5 Migration Guide

### Upgrading to Enhanced Runtime Schemas

Phase 5 adds enhanced runtime schemas while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing DynamicSchema usage.

#### Existing Code (Still Works)
```elixir
# All existing runtime schema code continues to work unchanged
fields = [{:name, :string, [required: true]}]
schema = Exdantic.Runtime.create_schema(fields)
{:ok, result} = Exdantic.Runtime.validate(data, schema)
```

#### New Enhanced Features
```elixir
# Create enhanced schema with model validators and computed fields
fields = [{:name, :string, [required: true]}]

validators = [fn data -> {:ok, %{data | name: String.trim(data.name)}} end]
computed = [{:display_name, :string, fn data -> {:ok, String.upcase(data.name)} end}]

enhanced_schema = Exdantic.Runtime.create_enhanced_schema(fields,
  model_validators: validators,
  computed_fields: computed
)

{:ok, result} = Exdantic.Runtime.validate_enhanced(data, enhanced_schema)
```

#### Unified Validation Interface
```elixir
# Use Exdantic.Runtime.Validator for unified interface
alias Exdantic.Runtime.Validator

# Works with both DynamicSchema and EnhancedSchema
{:ok, result} = Validator.validate(data, any_runtime_schema)
json_schema = Validator.to_json_schema(any_runtime_schema)
info = Validator.schema_info(any_runtime_schema)
```

### Breaking Changes
None. All existing code continues to work without modification.

### New Dependencies
None. Phase 5 uses only existing Exdantic modules and standard library functions.

### Performance Impact
- DynamicSchema validation performance unchanged
- EnhancedSchema adds minimal overhead for model validator and computed field execution
- JSON schema generation includes computed field metadata with negligible performance impact

## Implementation Notes

### Function Storage
Enhanced schemas store anonymous functions in a runtime function registry, ensuring they can be executed during validation while maintaining clean serialization for schema metadata.

### Error Handling
Enhanced schemas provide comprehensive error handling:
- Field validation errors maintain existing behavior
- Model validator errors include clear context and function references
- Computed field errors specify which computation failed and why
- Type validation errors for computed field return values

### JSON Schema Integration
Enhanced schemas generate JSON schemas that include:
- All regular fields with their types and constraints
- Computed fields marked as `readOnly: true`
- Enhanced metadata (`x-enhanced-schema`, `x-model-validators`, `x-computed-fields`)
- Full compatibility with existing JSON schema tooling

### Memory Management
Runtime functions are stored efficiently with unique generated names to prevent conflicts. The function registry is cleaned up when the schema is garbage collected.

## Testing Strategy

Phase 5 includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Basic enhanced schema creation and validation
- Model validator execution (named and anonymous functions)
- Computed field execution (named and anonymous functions)
- Error handling at each pipeline stage
- JSON schema generation with enhanced features
- Integration with existing validation infrastructure
- Performance benchmarks for enhanced vs basic schemas

All existing tests continue to pass, ensuring backward compatibility.
