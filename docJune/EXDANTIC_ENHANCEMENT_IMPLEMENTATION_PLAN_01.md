# Exdantic Enhancement Implementation Phases

## Overview
A layered, test-driven approach to adding struct pattern, model validators, and computed fields to Exdantic while maintaining 100% backward compatibility and the existing 530 passing tests.

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Struct Pattern Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Add optional struct generation without breaking existing functionality

**Features**:
- Add `define_struct: true/false` option to `use Exdantic`
- Generate struct definitions at compile time
- Modify validation to optionally return struct instances
- Add `dump/1` function for struct serialization

**Success Criteria**:
- All existing 530 tests pass
- New struct functionality works correctly
- Dialyzer remains green
- Zero breaking changes

### Phase 2: Named Function Model Validators (Week 2)
**Goal**: Add model-level validation using named function references

**Features**:
- Add `model_validator/1` macro that accepts function names
- Implement model validator execution after field validation
- Support multiple model validators in sequence
- Proper error handling and path preservation

**Success Criteria**:
- Model validators execute correctly
- Error paths are preserved
- Works with both struct and map return types
- Existing functionality unaffected

### Phase 3: Named Function Computed Fields (Week 3)
**Goal**: Add computed fields using named function references

**Features**:
- Add `computed_field/3` macro accepting name, type, and function name
- Execute computed fields after model validation
- Include computed fields in struct definition
- Mark computed fields as `readOnly` in JSON schema

**Success Criteria**:
- Computed fields execute after validation
- Fields appear in struct and JSON schema
- Type safety maintained
- Performance remains acceptable

### Phase 4: Anonymous Function Support (Week 4)
**Goal**: Add support for inline anonymous functions

**Features**:
- Extend macros to support `do:` blocks with anonymous functions
- Generate unique function names at compile time
- Support direct function literal syntax
- Maintain all existing named function capabilities

**Success Criteria**:
- Multiple syntax options work correctly
- Generated functions are properly named
- No performance degradation
- API remains intuitive

### Phase 5: Runtime Schema Enhancement (Week 5)
**Goal**: Extend runtime schemas with enhanced features

**Features**:
- Add enhanced features to `Runtime.create_schema/2`
- Support model validators and computed fields in runtime schemas
- Maintain compatibility with existing runtime functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Runtime schemas support all new features
- Performance acceptable for dynamic schemas
- API consistency with compile-time schemas

### Phase 6: Integration & Polish (Week 6)
**Goal**: Complete integration and performance optimization

**Features**:
- Integration with `EnhancedValidator`
- Performance optimization
- Documentation and examples
- Migration guides

**Success Criteria**:
- All features work together seamlessly
- Performance benchmarks met
- Complete documentation
- Clear upgrade path

## Risk Mitigation

### Backward Compatibility
- Every phase must pass all existing tests
- New features are additive only
- Default behavior unchanged

### Performance
- Benchmark critical paths in each phase
- No regression in validation performance
- Struct creation overhead minimized

### Code Quality
- Dialyzer must remain green
- Test coverage > 95% for new features
- Consistent error handling patterns

## Dependencies

### Phase 1 Dependencies
- No new external dependencies required
- May add development/testing utilities

### Later Phase Dependencies
- Consider property-based testing library (PropCheck)
- Benchmarking tools for performance validation
